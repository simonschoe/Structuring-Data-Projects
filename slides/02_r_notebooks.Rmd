##R Markdown Documents (`.Rmd`)
###The `YAML` Header

The **header** appears at the top of your `.Rmd` document. It contains a bunch of metadata as well as formatting options for your final report. The syntax for the header is based on [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

```
 ---
 title: "Rmarkdown Demo"    #Title/headline of your markdown report
 author: John Doe           #Name of the author
 date: 2020-08-29           #Date of the report
 output:                    #YAML options specifying the output
   html_document:               #Output format
     toc: true                  #Table of contents (toc)
     toc_float: true            #Floating toc on the left side of the document
     toc_depth: 2               #Depth of headers to generate toc
 ---
```

Only a small extract of options you can specify as part of the YAML header.

You can write plain text,
```
```
in *italics* or in **bold**,
```
```
and use S^uperscript^ or S~ubscript~.
```
```
You can format text as `fancy R code`,
```
```
and even embed LaTeX equations:
$$
x_{1/2} = -\frac{p}{2}\pm \sqrt{(\frac{p}{2})^2-q} 
$$
```

##R Markdown Documents (`.Rmd`)
###Code Chunks & Output

**Code Chunks:** Self-contained part of your `R` code for which, upon code evaluation, the output of your code is shown directly below the chunk instead of only in your console or the RStudio Viewer or the Plots pane.

```{r, echo=F, out.height='70%', out.width='70%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/fibo.PNG")
```
<br>
**Creating code chunks**:  
Using the *insert* button in the RStudio interface ![](../img/insert.PNG), or via keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + I

*Note: In fact, code chunks even allow you to write and evaluate code in other languages, such as Python, SQL or C++.*

???
The code is send from the chunk to your console where it is evaluated. The output is then send back to your code chunk where it is displayed below.

###Live Demo

.center[
```{r, echo=F}
countdown::countdown(
  minutes = 2, seconds = 0, 
  left = 0, right = 0, top = 0.5, bottom = 0.5,
  padding = "50px",
  margin = "7.5%",
  font_size = "5em"
)
```
]

???
show little green bar, talk about chunk names and chunk options, explain how code is sent to console and back, run inline expressions (cmd + enter)

---

##R Markdown Documents (`.Rmd`)
###Code Chunks & Output

**Chunk Options:** Can be set as boolean (**`T`**`rue`/**`F`**`alse`) arguments in the chunk header `{r ...}`.

```{r, echo=F}
df <- data.frame(
  Argument = c('include=F', 'eval=F', 'result=F', 'echo=F', 'message=F', 'warning=F'),
  Description = c(
    'Code and Output does not appear in the final report (yet, code is still evaluated).',
    'Output does not appear in the final report as the code is not evaluated.',
    'Output does not appear in the final report but the code is evaluated.',
    'Code does not appear in the final report.',
    'Messages generated by the code do not appear in the final report.',
    'Warnings generated by the code do not appear in the final report.'
  )
)

knitr::kable(df, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:100%;'")
```

##R Markdown Documents (`.Rmd`)
###Generating High-Quality Reports

Render the `.Rmd` document into your desired output format by using `knitr::render()` command from the `knitr` package or hit the *Knit* button in your RStudio toolbar.

--

```{r, echo=F, out.height='70%', out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61d189fd9cdf955058415d3e1b28dd60e1bd7c9b/b739c/lesson-images/rmarkdownflow.png")
```

**Workflow in the background:**

1. `knitr` takes your `.Rmd`-file and converts it into a plain markdown file (`.md`).
2. The `.md`-file is processed by `pandoc` to be converted into the final output format (e.g., PDF, HTML, Word).

*Note: `knitr` can only convert your final `.Rmd`-file if your code is free of errors as `knitr` tries to run your entire code as part of the conversion workflow!*

##Interactive Data Science Environments 
###Introduction to Computational Notebooks

**Computational Notebooks:** Computational notebooks are virtual environments used for [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). Thereby, they combine functionalities of word processors (e.g., MS Word) and the programming language kernel (e.g., the R shell which you find in the RStudio *Console* Tab).

Literate Programming:
- Writing human-readable computer programs
- Boils down to having the source code as well as natural language documentations in one file

Notebook Alternatives: Jupyter Notebook (language agnostic, but especially widespread in the Python area), R Notebook, Google Colab

##Interactive Data Science Environments 
###R Markdown Documents vs. R Notebooks

Primarily, both formats are based on `.Rmd`-files:
- An R Markdown document can be used as a computational notebook,
- and an R Notebook can be rendered to other R Markdown document types (e.g., PDF, HTML, Word).

A notebook (in the `R` universe) can be viewed as a special version of an Markdown document.

--

The use case is determined by your goal: generating high-quality reports/documents with R Markdown documents vs. doing data science / machine learning using R Notebooks.
.pull-left[
**R Markdown documents:**
- Execution of the whole code (batch execution)
- Requires code to be free of errors
]
.pull-right[
**R Notebooks:**
- Execution of the code interactively
- Preview is simply a snapshot of your notebook (see `.nb.html`-file)
]

???
First sentence: you will likely don't see any apparent differences between the two formats.

preview of .nb.html which updates everytime the file is saved (simple html snapshot of your notebook and not a final report, i.e. R does not checks that the whole output is free of error)

Highlight value of code chunks: split large code chunks or code chunks that generate more than one output into multiple chunks -> improve readability, transparency and user experience (also for your future self); also more easy to debug
