##Introduction to RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)

**What is an RStudio Project?**
RStudio Projects offer you a way to structure your data science project and improve your overall workflow:

- Keep all the files related to your data science project in a single place.
- Stop working on one or multiple `R scripts` and return later to continue where you left.
- Structure your project or analysis in a modular manner.
- Easily share your whole project with collaborators.

**How do I create an RStudio Project?**
`RStudio` provides three ways of creating an `.Rproj` (*File* -> *New Project...*):
1. As a new file directory
2. As part of an existing file directory
3. By cloning a version control repository

##Introduction to RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)

Here, I am creating a brand new directory, called `01_r_projects` in which I create this presentation:

```{r, echo=F, out.height='50%', out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/create-project-2.PNG")
```

##Introduction to RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)

**What happens when a new project is created?**
- RStudio creates a `.Rproj` file within the specified directory. This file contains certain project options and enables to open the *RStudio Project* from your machine's filesystem.
- RStudio creates a hidden directory (`.Rproj.user`) where project-related temporary files (e.g. auto-saved  documents) are stored.
- RStudio loads the `.Rproj` file and displays the project name on the far right side of the main toolbar.

**What happens when a new RStudio Project is opened?**
- A fresh `R` session is started.
- The `.RData` file in the project directory is loaded (depending on the project options).
- The `.Rhistory` file in the project directory is loaded into the *RStudio History pane*.
- Previously edited scripts are restored.
- The current *working directory* is set to the project directory (as previously specified, see [slide 5](#create-project)).

##Introduction to RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)

Let's have a look at the project directory of this presentation (maintained as an `.Rproj`):
```{r, eval=F}
getwd()
```
```
> [1] "C:/Users/.../workshops/01_rstudio_projects"
```
<br>
This path is referred to as an **absolute path**. What files do we find in the project directory?
```{r}
dir(".")
```

This is basically all the stuff required for rendering this presentation. Put differently: With an `.Rproj`, I organize all the files related to the project in one folder (e.g., script files, data sets, figures, manuscripts, etc.).

##Introduction to RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)

The dot ( `.` ) is a **relative path** to my project directory. Hence, it refers to:
```
> [1] "C:/Users/.../workshops/01_rstudio_projects"
```
<br>
Now, let's assume I want to access a file (`data.txt`) in the subfolder `data`, i.e. search for this file under:
```
> [1] "C:/Users/.../workshops/01_rstudio_projects/data"
```
<br>
What is the corresponding relative path when reading in the data?
```{r, warning=F, eval=F}
read.delim("./data/data.txt", header = T, sep = ",")
```
<br>
The use of relative paths makes it very easy to navigate within your project or share it with collaborators without having to adjust every path manually.

.footnote[
*Note: If you want to step one folder up in the folder hierarchy, you may use two dots ( `..` ). When writing paths on Windows, use `/` instead of `\` , otherwise `R` interprets it as an escape character.*

##Introduction to RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)

**Project options:** Access project options within `RStudio` by navigating to *Tools -> Project Options...* .

- **Save workspace to `.RData` on exit:** Stores your current `global environment` (workspace) in an `.RData` file in your project directory when closing your *RStudio Project*.<br><br>
*Not recommended! You should always be able to recreate your global environment from your scripts. Hence, I would set this behavior of Rstudio to "never" (Tools -> Global Options...).*<br><br>
- **Restore `.RData` into workspace at startup:** Loads your previously saved workspace from the `.RData` file into the `global environment`.<br><br>
- **Always save history:** Writes your code history (see history pane) into an `.Rhistory` file located in your project directory.
