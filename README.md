# Structuring Data Projects in RStudio

This 1 hour workshop introduces the basic tools for setting up and conducting data projects using the RStudio IDE. The goal is to improve the participants overall data science and machine learning workflow by setting up an RStudio project, performing analyses in an interactive notebook environment and maintaining local project libraries.

More specifically, after the workshop participants will
- be familiar with features of RStudio projects (`.Rproj`) as well as the differences between absolute and relative directory paths,
- know their way around R Markdown documents (`.Rmd`) and embrace R Notebooks as the primary tool for doing interactive data science and machine learning in `R`,
- see the value in using local project environments to prevent dependency errors, promote collaboration, and ensure reproducibility.


*The workshop is part of "Machine Learning in R" graduate course held at University of MÃ¼nster, School of Business and Economics in the winter term 2020/21.*
