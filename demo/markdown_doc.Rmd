**Wikipedia extract:** Fibonacci numbers are named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci. In his 1202 book Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics,[5] although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics, as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

```{r fibonacci, warning=F}
fib <- function(n) {
  x <-  numeric(n)
  x[1:2] <- c(1,1)
  for(i in 3:n) {
    x[i] = x[i-1] + x[i-2]
  }
  return(x)
}

Sys.sleep(5)

fib(10)
```

We can even run in-line, so-called inline expressions: `r fib(15)`.
