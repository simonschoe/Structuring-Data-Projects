# Text body

You can write plain text,
in *italics* or in **bold**,
and use S^uperscript^ or S~ubscript~.
You can format text as `fancy R code`,
and even embed LaTeX equations:
$$
x_{1/2} = -\frac{p}{2}\pm \sqrt{(\frac{p}{2})^2-q} 
$$


# You can use headers (H1)
## You can use headers (H2)
### You can use headers (H3)
#### You can use headers (H4)
##### You can use headers (H5)


> You can highlight quotes,

embed [Hyperlink](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf),
or include images: ![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/49/65/32496554a4f599228677bbf7919024bb.png),


- You can create an
    - unordered list
        - of items

1. Or even better
2. an ordered list
  1. which should
  2. look familiar!
  
  
And finally, since we are in an academic context you might also want use some footnotes[^1]
[^1]: Insert footnote

# Code Chunks

```{r fibonacci}
fib <- function(n) {
  x <-  numeric(n)
  x[1:2] <-  c(1,1)
  for(i in 3:n) {
    x[i] = x[i-1] + x[i-2]
  }
  return(x)
}

Sys.sleep(5)

fib(10)
```

We can even run in-line, so-called inline expressions: `r fib(15)`.
